# Deploy your Pipeline

Once you have enabled your Application to be deployed via the Pipeline, review the settings and different stages.

- Click on the <kbd> : </kbd> button next to the Pipeline you enabled in the previous step
- Click on <kbd> Edit Config </kbd>

From here you can review the stages and what happens within the stages.

- Click on <kbd> Show Advanced Options </kbd> to get an idea of how you can trigger the Pipeline to run

When ready click on <kbd> Cancel or Done </kbd> 

- Click on the <kbd> : </kbd> button next to the Pipeline you enabled in the previous step
- Click on <kbd> Run </kbd>
- Click on the Branch you wish to Run and click on <kbd> Run </kbd>

Once running the Pipeline, Rancher will install a Jenkins engine to run the pipeline.  You will be able to watch the progress in the main page.  The first time you run this exercise it may take a few minutes to begin, subsequent runs of the Pipeline will take less time due to the Jenkins Engine already installed.

Review the Applicatiomn just installed.

_Congratulations - you have just enabled a Pipeline from inside the Rancher UI._

_Before exiting - feel free to have a look around and see what else you can do.  If you are ready though - feel free to hit continue and move onto another demonstration of Rancher and Kubernetes._
