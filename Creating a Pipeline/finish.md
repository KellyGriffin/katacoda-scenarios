# Congratulations

You have just deployed a Rancher Server, K3S and deployed an application via Pipeline.

Whilst we have just scratched the surface of integrating your CI/CD methodology across your Kubernetes environment, the exercise is all about showing how straightfoward it is to deploying your custom Applications from your centralised Kubernetes management platform - Rancher.

There is so much more we can do now with the environment - so ahead and deploy some workloads, scale the deployments, etc.  The limits to what can be done within a Kubernetes environment is endless.  

Have fun and Go Build.
