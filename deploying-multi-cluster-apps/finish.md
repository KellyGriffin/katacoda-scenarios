# Congratulations

You have just deployed a Rancher Server, K3S and deployed a Multi-Cluster Application.

Whilst we have just scratched the surface of deploying Applications across your Kubernetes environment, the exercise is all about showing how straightfoward it is to deploying consistent Applications from your centralised Kubernetes management platform - Rancher.

There is so much more we can do now with the environment - so ahead and deploy some workloads, scale the deployments, etc.  The limits to what can be done within a Kubernetes environment is endless.  

Have fun and Go Build.
