# Congratulations

You have just deployed a Rancher Server, K3S and reviewed how the Kubernetes Hoizontal Pod Autoscaling feature works.

There is so much more we can do now with the environment - so ahead and deploy some workloads, scale the deployments, etc.  The limits to what can be done within a Kubernetes environment is endless.  

Have fun and Go Build.
