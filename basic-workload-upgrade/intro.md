Welcome, this tutorial will guide you through the installation of a Rancher 2.2 server and a single K3S Kubernetes environment.

By leveraging the Katacoda environment, you will be able to setup an environment quickly, safely and without any Cloud provider costs.

This exercise will deploy a v1 of a workload which we will then upgrade to v2 via the Rancher UI.

You can restart the exercise at any time by refreshing your browser.  Please not though that all previous configurations and data will be lost.  No data is saved when using the Katacoda environment so please use at your own risk.

You are responsible for any configurations made and for saving any configurations that you wish to keep.  Rancher and Katacoda are not responsible for any configurations made to the demonstration environment.
