# Congratulations

You have just deployed a Rancher Server, K3S and configured a Cluster.

You also depolyed a workload and exposed it to the Internet.  From there you were able to change the version and, if you wanted to rollback to the previous version.

There is so much more we can do now with the environment - so ahead and deploy some workloads, scale the deployments, etc.  The limits to what can be done within a Kubernetes environment is endless.  

Have fun and Go Build.
