# Congratulations

You have just deployed a Rancher Server, K3S and configured Monitoring.

Whilst we have just scratched the surface of Monitoring, the exercise is all about providing visibility into the Cluster from your centralised Kubernetes management platform - Rancher.

There is so much more we can do now with the environment - so ahead and deploy some workloads, scale the deployments, etc.  The limits to what can be done within a Kubernetes environment is endless.  

Have fun and Go Build.
